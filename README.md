# SchedulingAssistant
An example of how to schedule the courses for days with different tracks which can be chosen per convenience.

Problem statement is to have the possible schedule given for a particular day. This is a problem invovling sequencing and probably genetic algorithms for dynamic complexity which may arise. I had tried to place the code as linear and isolated as possible.
